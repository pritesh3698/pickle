In general, the number of test cases for an IaC script to move to the next environment can vary based on project complexity, but let's make some assumptions:

1. **Basic Functionality:**
   - Provisioning: 3 test cases (Verify VM/Resource creation, Networking setup, Storage allocation)
   - Configuration: 2 test cases (Ensure correct software configurations, Validate environment-specific settings)

2. **Security:**
   - Access Controls: 2 test cases (Check user permissions, Validate network security groups)
   - Secrets Management: 1 test case (Ensure secure handling of sensitive information)

3. **Scalability:**
   - Performance: 2 test cases (Test for resource scaling, Evaluate system response under load)

4. **Deployment:**
   - Blue-Green Deployment: 2 test cases (Verify parallel deployment, Ensure rollback functionality)

5. **Integration:**
   - External Services: 2 test cases (Check integrations with external databases/services)
   - API Calls: 1 test case (Validate communication with external APIs)

This is a rough estimate, and the actual number can vary based on project-specific requirements. It's crucial to tailor your test cases to ensure adequate coverage of your IaC script's functionality, security, and performance considerations.
